        <h2>New Residency Requirement for Grenada's E-2 Visa Applicants</h2>
        <p>In a significant update to the E-2 Treaty Investor Visa application process, individuals who obtain Grenada citizenship through investment now face a new prerequisite. A residency requirement mandates a three-year period of living in Grenada before E-2 visa eligibility.</p>
        <p>This adjustment aims to deepen the ties between new citizens and their chosen country of investment, ensuring that the benefits of such programs extend beyond the economic to foster genuine community integration.</p>
        
        <h3>Understanding the Change</h3>
        <p>The E-2 visa offers non-U.S. citizens the chance to start and operate a business within the United States, given that their home country holds a treaty of commerce with the U.S. Grenada has been a popular choice for many investors due to its participation in the E-2 treaty and its citizenship by investment program.</p>
        
        <h3>Implications for Investors</h3>
        <p>Prospective investors must now plan for an extended timeline, considering the three-year residency before initiating their E-2 visa application. This requirement emphasizes the importance of long-term commitment to Grenada, impacting the decision-making process for many.</p>
        
        <h3>Preparing for the E-2 Visa Application</h3>
        <p>Documentation and evidence of genuine residency will be crucial. Applicants should gather substantial proof of their life and contributions to Grenada during this period.</p>
