        <h1>Unlocking U.S. Residency Through the EB-5 Visa Program</h1>
        <p>The EB-5 Visa offers a path to U.S. residency for investors around the globe. This guide explores the program’s qualifications and procedures, helping you navigate your investment journey.</p>

        <!-- Introduction to EB-5 Benefits -->
        <section class="step">
            <h2>Benefits of the EB-5 Visa</h2>
            <p>The EB-5 Visa program opens the door to U.S. residency by investing in American enterprises. It not only allows the investor to live, work, or study in the U.S. but also paves the way for citizenship. A minimum investment of $900,000 in targeted employment areas (TEAs) or $1.8 million in non-TEAs is required, offering a direct route to a Green Card.</p>

        <!-- Detailed Explanation of Qualifications -->
        <section class="step">
            <h2>Qualifying for the EB-5 Visa</h2>
            <p>To qualify for the EB-5 Visa, investors must meet specific criteria, including investing in a new commercial enterprise, creating or preserving at least 10 full-time jobs for qualifying U.S. workers, and ensuring the investment comes from a lawful source. The process demands meticulous documentation to prove compliance.</p>

        <!-- The Application Process -->
        <section class="step">
            <h2>The EB-5 Application Process</h2>
            <p>The application process involves filing Form I-526 to demonstrate eligibility, investing the required capital in a qualifying U.S. enterprise, and applying for a conditional Green Card through Form I-485 or DS-260. After two years, investors must file Form I-829 to remove conditions on their residency.</p>
