    <section class="step" id="insufficient-documentation">
        <h2>Insufficient Documentation</h2>
        <p>One of the most common reasons for E-2 visa refusal is the lack of adequate documentation to demonstrate the investment, business plan, or the essential skills of the applicant. Ensuring thorough and relevant documentation is key to a successful application.</p>

    <section class="step" id="investment-not-substantial">
        <h2>Investment Not Considered Substantial</h2>
